# **LoS MIMO: Line of Sight MIMO in Microwave Links, assigned by Nokia**
This repository explores **Line of Sight (LoS) MIMO** systems for microwave point-to-point communication, focusing on **antenna spacing** and **signal capacity** across different frequencies.

## **Key Features:**
- **Mathematical Model**: Capacity calculations using channel matrix **H** and **SNR**.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Impact of **antenna displacement** and **frequency changes**.
