LoS MIMO: Line of Sight MIMO in Microwave Links,
assigned by Nokia in the constest of Infortmation theory course.
This repository explores Line of Sight (LoS) MIMO systems used in microwave point-to-point communication, focusing on optimizing antenna spacing and signal capacity across various frequencies.

Key Features:
Mathematical Model: Capacity calculations based on channel matrix H and SNR.
Sensitivity Analysis: Effects of antenna displacement and frequency variations.
